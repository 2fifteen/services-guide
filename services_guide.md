# Services Guide

This Services Guide contains provisions that define and clarify the services described in the quote provided to you. The Services Guide describes all managed services provided by 2Fifteen Tech. This is a comprehensive guide to all services available to all customers. We do not provide every service listed here to every customer. Please refer to your quote for specific services provided.

#### Initial Discovery Phase

When we start working together, we'll take a close look at your IT setup. This is our chance to really understand how your technology is performing and how well it's prepared for the managed services we're going to provide. Each discovery is a little different, but typically follows the flow outlined below:

1. **General Check-Up:** We'll assess how ready your IT environment is for our services and see how things are functioning overall.  
     
2. **Hardware and Software Review:** We'll take a look at the tech you're using and the software that powers it.  
     
3. **Vendor Service Check:** We'll review your current contracts and warranties for your hardware and software.  
     
4. **Backup and Disaster Recovery Audit:** We'll review any existing backup and disaster recovery plans and processes.  
     
5. **Internet Provider Review:** We'll look into what kind of connections are provided to you, and what the connection is supposed to provide.  
     
6. **Asset Inventory:** We'll make a comprehensive list of all your IT assets.  
     
7. **Email, Website, and Domain Hosting Review:** We'll audit how these crucial services are running.  
     
8. **IT Support Process Review:** We'll look at how your IT support works right now.

If we find anything during our audit – like outdated equipment or software that's not properly licensed – we'll be sure to let you know. We'll talk about how these issues could affect our services and offer you solutions.

⚠️ **Heads up!** Our audit is focused on identifying potential issues, but it doesn't include fixing them. If something needs fixing that is not covered by our managed services outlined in the quote, it will be addressed separately, and we'll provide you with a separate quote for that work.

The initial discovery is primarily to catch large items that need to be addressed immediately or may hinder our ability to support you. It is not intended to catch everything. We continuously monitor and review active client environments to update recommendations and will work with you to address them.

#### Onboarding Services

As we kick off our work together, our first step is to get your IT environment ready for our monthly managed services. Think of this as setting the stage for a smooth partnership. Here's what we'll do:

1. **Set up our Support Systems:** To kick things off, we set up individual environments for each customer in our management systems, getting ready to handle support tickets, day to day management, and set the infrastructure up for our automated monitoring and alert systems.  
     
2. **Clean up old Software:** We'll remove any monitoring tools or software left by previous IT teams, if necessary.  
     
3. **Taking Stock:** We'll inventory your important devices – servers, workstations, laptops, and the software running on them.  
     
4. **Upgrading Endpoint Security:** We remove any previous or unused security software on endpoints and install our market leading solution.  
     
5. **Setting Up Remote Support:** We'll install a remote access application on each device, so we can help you no matter where you are.  
     
6. **Software Health Check:** We'll see which software updates you need.  
     
7. **Tuning Up Devices:** If necessary, we will perform disk cleanups and security scans to keep things running smoothly.  
     
8. **Firewall and Network Review:** We'll make sure your network is working as intended and that security configurations are sufficient for your business needs.  
     
9. **Server Review:** We'll document how any servers are set up and performing.  
     
10. **Backup Strategy Evaluation:** We'll assess your current backup approach and recommend improvements.  
      
11. **Personalized Recommendations:** If we see areas for improvement, we'll let you know.

We plan several check-ins with each customer during onboarding, helping us get to know the environment, expectations, and areas we can provide a rapid impact on the business. These meetings are a crucial part of being successful in our partnership.

This plan might change a bit as we dig deeper – we want to make sure we're doing what's best for your setup. If we spot any problems during this phase, we'll talk to you about how they might affect our services.

We start supporting you as soon as the agreement starts, however onboarding is really the process of working with you to get all of the information we will need about your environment, so that we are able to proactively support and have enough insight to make recommendations tailored to your business. The onboarding timeline can vary, depending on factors like product availability and third-party requirements. We can't promise an exact duration, but we'll keep you in the loop about our progress.

#### Ongoing / Recurring Services

Think of our ongoing services as the continuous support we provide after setting up your IT environment.

### Managed Services Explained

Our managed services are the regular support and maintenance we provide for your IT systems. This is what keeps everything running smoothly. You'll find these services detailed in your monthly bill. What's included? Well, that depends on what we agreed upon in your service plan. Remember, if it's not in your Quote, it's not covered – unless we say otherwise in writing.

⚠️ **Note** - In quotes, this is summarized as On-site and Remote Support, or Automated Support.

### Remote Monitoring and Management

This is our tech watchdog service. We install software on your IT equipment that keeps an eye on things 24/7. It alerts us if something's up, and we respond based on our agreed service levels.

This includes, but is not limited to: 

* **Capacity Monitoring:** We're alerted if your disk space gets too low, so we can act before it becomes a problem.   
* **Routine Checks:** Regular inspections and clean-ups of your operating system to keep things running efficiently.   
* **Updates and Patches:** We manage the updates and patches for your software to keep everything up-to-date and secure.   
* **Hardware Failures:** We monitor for several types of hardware failures and alert you if one is detected.   
* **Backup Monitoring:** We keep tabs on the backups we provide. Our system checks whether your data is being backed up properly and alerts us to any problems like backup failures or space issues. This way, we make sure your data is always there when you need it.   
* **Endpoint Security Software:** We make sure our Endpoint Security Software is installed, running, and up to date on all your devices.   
* **Network Monitoring:** When using compatible hardware, we actively monitor your network, watching for uptime and other factors that affect network performance. We also monitor security events and ensure that security policies and signatures remain updated.

### Remote Helpdesk

Need help? Our remote support team is here for you during business hours. They're ready to assist with any issues you have with your managed devices and software.

### Remote Infrastructure Maintenance / System Administration

We watch your IT infrastructure closely. This includes setting things up, monitoring them, and doing all the necessary maintenance to prevent issues. If something can't be fixed remotely, don't worry – we'll send a technician to your place. Just note that this depends on our techs' availability and scheduling.

### Backup and Disaster Recovery

We've got your back(up). We set up and manage a backup and file recovery system using third-party solutions. This includes: • 24/7 automated monitoring of your backups, including offsite and onsite backups (if applicable and compatible). • Fixing any issues with backup disks.

### Backup Retention

We work with you to determine a backup retention policy that fits your business needs.

### Backup Alerts

If anything goes wrong with the backups on your managed servers, we'll get an alert and jump into action.

### Synology C2 Backup - Smart Recycle

As part of our backup services for Synology devices, we utilize Smart Recycle, an intelligent backup retention system designed to optimize storage while preserving critical restore points. This is our default policy, unless a specific agreement with any customer specifies otherwise for specific business purposes.

Smart Recycle will retain backup versions according to the following schedule:

• **Hourly Versions (Last 24 Hours)** The system keeps the earliest version created each hour during the past 24 hours.

• **Daily Versions (From 1 Day to 1 Month)** The system keeps the earliest version created each day for backups aged between 1 day and 1 month.

• **Weekly Versions (Older than 1 Month)** The system keeps the earliest version created each week for backups older than 1 month.

### Compliance

We have a wide range of experience with different compliance frameworks. We have compliance management tools to provide templates and control monitoring to help you build a roadmap to become compliant, or to help monitor your existing compliance with different frameworks.

Frameworks we help with include but are not limited to: 

* SOC2 Type I & II   
* ISO 27001   
* HIPAA   
* NIST CSF   
* CIS   
* PCI   
* And others

### Data Recovery

In some scenarios, our backup solutions offer a self-service option for people to recover their own data. We are also happy to help recover data from a backup. If you would like our help with recovering from a backup, you must submit a ticket via email, phone call, or SMS to our support desk, and we will begin working on the request as soon as we can within normal business hours.

Contact information for our support desk can be found in your quote, and will be provided during the onboarding process.

### Network Management

When using compatible networks, we actively monitor your network, watching for uptime and other factors that impact network performance. We also monitor security events and ensure that security policies and signatures remain updated.

⚠️ **Note** - The availability of specific features of network monitoring will depend on the specific equipment that is installed. We always monitor what we are able to for clients, based on the compatibility of their networks with our monitoring and alerting systems.

Other network services include but are not limited to: 

* Maintaining software / firmware updates   
* Implementing Intrusion Detection / Intrusion Prevention Systems (IDS and IPS)   
* Network filtering   
  * Layer 7 Application filtering   
  * DNS filtering   
* Managed VPN   
* Modern VPN remote access replacement - For modern or complex scenarios with remote workers, or needed simplicity and flexibility and additional security.   
* Software Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN), Secure Access Service Edge (SASE), and Zero Trust Networking (ZTN) are available to be configured and managed by 2Fifteen with the appropriate hardware or licensing.

We do not guarantee internet connectivity through your Internet Service Provider (ISP). While we will make best efforts to assist in restoring connectivity with your ISP, uptime cannot be assured during their outages. Additionally, it's important to note that we are not responsible for internet service shutoff due to billing or illegal use of the internet connection, such as torrenting performed on the network. Furthermore, we do not guarantee performance in instances associated with low bandwidth service offerings.

### Email Threat Protection

Email compromise is the number 1 vector used for attackers to gain access to company systems or services. Email typically provides a lot of sensitive information, but is also frequently used for password resets, meaning if an attacker gains access to your email, they can often use that to pivot to other systems you have access to. We have partnered with some of the leading companies in the email security space to offer email security. Here are some of the ways it can benefit you and your company:

* **Strong Defense Against Email Threats:** We guard your inbox against phishing scams, business email compromise (BEC) attacks, SPAM, and harmful email-based malware.   
* **Impersonation Attack Protection:** Our system uses Friendly Name filters to catch sneaky social engineering attacks, keeping you safe from impersonators.   
* **Phishing and Social Engineering Prevention:** We're always on the lookout for common tricks used by cybercriminals to protect you from phishing and other deceptive tactics.   
* **New Domain Monitoring:** Any emails from newly registered or unfamiliar domains are blocked – this helps catch fraudsters before they get to you.   
* **Display Name Spoofing Shield:** We stop attempts to trick you with fake sender names.   
* **Lookalike Domain Detection:** Our system is sharp at spotting and blocking domains that look or sound like legitimate ones, preventing confusion and potential threats.

⚠️ **Note** - Email threat protection is only available for Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 accounts

### Managed DMARC

DMARC is now required for successful email delivery from many of the largest email servers around the world. We offer fully managed DMARC management and reporting to ensure that you have everything configured correctly and that your domain email usage is being monitored for deliverability and any threats. DMARC records also prevent malicious actors from successfully spoofing your email or domain.

### Security Training

We offer easy-to-access online security training courses, which can be assigned to employees automatically. Our system will track compliance with each employee, and can be configured to have employees redo necessary training as required. While it is designed to be at your own pace, we can also set deadlines based on the business needs. These training sessions are short and easy for anyone to follow, regardless of their comfort level with technology.

### Virtual / Fractional Chief Information Officer (vCIO)

Think of our vCIO services as your personal tech strategy guide. Here are some of the things the vCIO service offers:

* **Planning and Budgeting Help:** We assist in creating plans and budgets for your data and information needs.   
* **Compliance and Best Practices:** We review the latest best practices and discuss how to stay compliant with current requirements and frameworks.   
* **Strategic Tech Guidance:** Get expert advice on various technologies to help drive your business forward.   
* **Customized Standards:** We develop standards and practices tailored specifically for your company.   
* **Tech Education and Recommendations / Technology Alignment:** We keep you informed about business technologies and offer recommendations that suit your needs.   
* **Regular Meetings:** We participate in scheduled meetings to ensure we're always aligned with your goals.   
* **Documentation:** We take care of maintaining all necessary technology documentation for you.   
* **Technology Usage Improvement:** We assess your current technology use and recommend ways to improve and optimize it.

#### Covered Equipment

### Hardware Management

* **Managed Hardware:** Our Managed Services apply to devices with our software monitoring agents. We'll generate a list of these devices, known as "Managed Hardware," after we set everything up. We can change this list together if needed (just an email will do), but we might also adjust it if we find devices that should be included but aren't yet.   
* **Technical Support:** We're here to help with your Managed Devices. We do not directly do repairs, but have partners that do perform repairs when needed. We will help facilitate any necessary repair processes under the manufacturer's recommendations, and the current warranty status of the device. Note that our agreement does not cover any repair costs that are incurred and will be passed on when necessary.

### Software Support

* **Supported Software:** We support software licensed through us, which we call "Supported Software," and any software listed in the agreement quote. With all supported software we will do our best to resolve issues directly, but will also assist with escalating more complex issues directly to the vendor or supplier.   
* **Non-Supported Software:** If it's not in your plan, it's not covered. We can still try to help with other software on a "best effort" basis, but this may be billed separately. Our advice on software is considered a recommendation, not an ongoing commitment. For non-supported software, we will need to work with the vendor, along with someone from your company, but we will help find a resolution to any issues we can.

⚠️ **Important Note:** 2Fifteen Tech does not warrant or guarantee the performance, availability, or reliability of any third-party tool, platform, or service. Support for third-party systems is offered on a best-effort basis and is subject to the availability and limitations of those systems.

### User-Based Services

* **Per User Basis:** We tailor our services for up to three devices per user: one tablet (like an iPad), one iPhone (or other phone that is compatible with our management services and software), and one desktop or laptop.   
* **Exceptions:** We can consider more devices or user scenarios, but there might be extra charges.   
* **Business Device Definition:** A "business device" is one that you own or lease for work, is usually connected to your managed network, and has our monitoring software installed. These are what we refer to as "managed hardware."

### Physical Locations

* **Remote First:** We handle most of our services remotely. In some cases, an on-site visit may be necessary. If we determine that someone needs to go on-site, we will schedule a technician to stop by. If we work with another contractor for an on-site visit, we will communicate that beforehand.   
* **Scheduling Visits:** If we need to visit, we'll schedule it based on how urgent the issue is and when our technicians are available. In some cases, there might be extra fees for these onsite visits. You can find more details in your specific quote.   
* **Tech Team Assignments:** We can't take requests for specific technicians for remote or onsite support. Our team works together to ensure everyone gets top-notch service, no matter who's on the job.

#### Google and Microsoft 365

2Fifteen Tech is a partner with Google and Microsoft to provide our customers with the leading productivity platforms. Managing users, license management, configuration management, etc. are included in our Managed Services agreement, however purchasing licenses is separate from the main managed services agreement.

We are able to facilitate license purchases and agreements for our customers through Google and Microsoft's partner channels, however all of the licensing terms from the respective companies still apply regardless of where licenses are purchased.

⚠️ **Note** - Discounts are typically applied when customers agree to annual agreements instead of flexible month-to-month agreements. The customer is responsible for the full amount of that contract.

Working with us as a direct partner of Google and Microsoft allows us to help navigate the complexity of different SKU's, licenses, products, and services. We will help your company determine the level of functionality necessary for your business goals and ensure that your business operations continue as smoothly as possible.

### Microsoft Licensing Fees

* **Getting You Set Up:** For applications like Microsoft 365, Windows 365, and Microsoft Power Platform, we need to buy specific licenses from Microsoft, called New Commerce Experience (NCE) Licenses.   
* **One-Year Term Commitment:** Discounts are available for 1-year commitments. If you decide to go that route, you will be responsible for the full term of the commitment.   
* **No Cancellations or Transfers:** Once we buy an NCE License, it's yours for the year – no cancellations or passing it to someone else. This means you'll need to cover the cost for the full term, even if you decide to stop using our services.   
* **Using Your Licenses:** If you've paid for these licenses, you can use them until they expire, even if you switch to a different service provider.

### Google Workspace Licensing Fees

* **Google Workspace Options:** We offer various Google Workspace editions - from Business Starter to Enterprise Plus.   
* **One-Year Term for Discounts:** Like with Microsoft, we buy these licenses for a year to get Google's discounts and pass the savings to you.   
* **License Terms:** Google Workspace Licenses, once purchased, are yours for the term. They can't be canceled or transferred to another customer. So, if you end our services, you'll still need to pay for the full license term.   
* **Full Term Payment:** Remember, you're committing to the full term of the licenses once they're purchased, regardless of service changes.

### Google Workspace / Microsoft 365 Administration

Part of our Managed Services includes administration of Google Workspace and / or Microsoft 365. Administration includes services such as -

* **User Licensing:** We help ensure you have the correct licenses for your needs, have enough licenses for your users, and that the correct licenses are assigned to the correct users.   
* **Account Management:** We help create new users, remove former users, enforce strong authentication policies such as strong passwords and multi-factor authentication, group memberships, and more.   
* **Email configuration:** We ensure email is configured correctly, and both incoming and outgoing email are functioning properly. We also assist with ensuring your DNS records such as SPF records, DKIM and DMARC management, MX records, and other records that impact email deliverability are configured correctly.   
* **Configuration recommendations and implementation:** There are thousands of different configuration settings in Google Workspace and Microsoft 365, and we help make recommendations on best practices as they apply to your specific organization. Once approved, we assist in implementing those recommended configurations.   
* **Data management best practices:** We will make recommendations on how to best manage data in your Google or Microsoft environments, such as Google Drive, OneDrive, or Sharepoint, based on your organization's needs.

#### Service Levels

* **Automated Monitoring:** Our automated monitoring runs all the time – 24/7, every day of the year. We're always keeping an eye on things.   
* **Business Hours Support:** Our business hours are Monday to Friday, 8:30 AM to 5:30 PM Mountain Time, excluding holidays. The holidays 2Fifteen Tech is closed are listed here - [https://215.tech/service](https://215.tech/service).   
* **Response Time:** If something goes wrong, we aim to start tackling it within 1 business hour from the time you let us know through our official support channels (email, SMS, or phone - sent to our service desk). If someone reaches out outside of our support desk official channels, the response and resolution time may be longer.   
* **After-Hours Help:** We do not currently staff outside of our business hours, and cannot guarantee any after hours support. Any exceptions would be called out in your quote.   
* **Hourly Billing Details:** If your quote includes any hourly billing options, then we bill in 15-minute increments, rounding up to the nearest quarter hour. And there's a minimum charge of one hour for any help outside of business hours.

#### Professional Services and Project Work

All project work, including custom implementations or professional services outside of managed services, must be mutually agreed upon in writing. Scope, timing, and cost will be defined in a separate quote that must be accepted by the client prior to project commencement.

#### Fees

* **Initial Quote:** The fees for our services are as outlined in your Quote.   
* **Changes in Service Needs:** If your needs change (like more users or different services), your monthly fees will adjust accordingly automatically.   
* **Minimum Monthly Fees:** The initial fee in your Quote is the lowest you'll be billed each month. Even if you use fewer services or have fewer users, this minimum fee still applies, unless we both agree to lower it. Any changes must be in writing and agreed upon by both of us.   
* **Late Payment Fees:** If an invoice is not paid by the due date, interest will be added to the invoice. This interest will be 12% per year, calculated from the day after the payment was due until the day it is fully paid.   
* **Possible Fee Increases:**   
  * **Our Increases:** We might need to raise our fees now and then. If it's more than a 5% increase from last year, we'll give you 60 days to decide if you want to continue or cancel our services. You're responsible for all fees and costs up until the cancellation date.   
  * **Third-Party Increases:** If our third-party providers hike their prices, we might need to pass those costs onto you. We don't control these increases, but we'll give you a heads-up.  
  *  **Note:** These third-party increases are separate from our own fee changes and won't count in the 5% increase limit.

### Travel Time for Onsite Services

* **Travel Included:** We cover travel up to 45 minutes from our office to yours at no extra charge.   
* **Beyond 45 Minutes:** If it takes longer than 45 minutes to get to you, we'll bill you for the extra travel time at our current hourly rates. We'll also bill for any tolls, parking, or related travel expenses.

### Appointment Cancellations

* **Rescheduling/Cancellation Policy:** You can cancel or reschedule appointments without a fee if you let us know at least one business day in advance.   
* **Late Cancellations/No-Shows:** If you cancel late, aren't there for the appointment, or if we can't access your location, you'll be charged for two hours of our consulting time (business or non-business hours rate, as applicable).

### Payment Methods

* **Automated Payment:** You can pay via credit card or ACH. We'll try ACH first, and if that fails, we'll use your credit card.   
* **ACH Payments:** By opting for ACH, you authorize us to debit your designated account for payments. If a payment fails (like insufficient funds), we'll charge a $35.00 service fee.   
* **Credit Card Payments:** If you choose credit card payments, we'll charge your designated card for any payments due. Credit card payments will have a 3.5% processing fee added. 

#### Additional Terms

### Authenticity

To receive our services, it is essential that all components within the managed environment, including hardware and software, are genuine and properly licensed. If we request proof of authenticity or licensing, it is your responsibility to provide the necessary documentation. Additionally, it is important to adhere to the minimum hardware and software requirements outlined in the Quote or this Services Guide. These requirements must be implemented and maintained to ensure the continuity of our services.

### Monitoring Services; Alert Services

Unless stated otherwise in the quote, our monitoring and alert services are limited to detecting and notifying clients. Please note our SLA does not cover monitoring and alert services. These services are guided by client-defined policies, which can be modified as needed or desired by the client. Initially, the policies will be set to a baseline standard determined by 2Fifteen. However, we recommend that clients establish or modify policies to meet their specific monitoring and notification requirements.

### Remediation

Unless specified otherwise in the Quote, remediation services will be provided based on industry best practices for managed services. Please note that these services are not intended to be, and should not be considered as, a warranty or guarantee of the functionality of the Environment, or a service plan for repairing specific managed hardware or software.

### Configuration of Third Party Services

Modifying the configurations of certain third-party services may impact services provided and in some cases may result in increased fees. We recommend obtaining authorization before making any changes to the configurations to avoid disruptions and additional costs.

### Modification of Environment

Please do not make any changes to the environment without our permission. Unauthorized changes can negatively impact the services and may affect the fees charged under the quote. This includes modifying hardware, installing applications, or adjusting configuration or log files. We request that you let us know prior to making any modifications to your environment.

### Co-Managed Environment

In situations where we work alongside other vendors or personnel (referred to as "Co-managed Providers") who provide overlapping or conflicting services, we will strive to efficiently implement our Services. However, please note that we will not be responsible for the actions or mistakes of Co-Managed Providers, or for resolving any issues, errors, or downtime caused by them. If a Co-Managed Provider's decision on a matter differs from our position regarding a Service, we will defer to their decision and inform you of the situation.

### Endpoint Security

Our endpoint security solution aims to protect your environment from new malicious software (Malware). However, please note that any pre-existing Malware in your environment at the time of implementation may not be removable without additional services, which may incur an additional charge. We cannot guarantee that all Malware will be detectable, avoidable, or removable, nor can we guarantee the recoverability of any data that has been erased, corrupted, or encrypted by Malware.

To enhance security awareness, you agree that 2Fifteen or its designated third-party affiliate may transfer information regarding the results of processed files, URL reputation determination, security risk tracking, and statistics for protection against spam and Malware. Please note that any information obtained this way will contain no personal or confidential information.

We specifically target and protect against various types of malicious software, including but not limited to: 

* **Viruses:** Malware that infects a computer system by attaching itself to a file or program and replicating when executed.   
* **Worms:** Self-replicating malware that spreads through a computer network without user action.   
* **Trojans:** Malware that disguises itself as a legitimate program or file to deceive users and gain unauthorized access to their systems.   
* **Ransomware:** Malware that encrypts a victim's files or system and demands payment for decryption.   
* **Spyware:** Malware that secretly collects user activity information without their knowledge or consent.   
* **Adware:** Malware that displays unwanted advertisements or pop-ups in exchange for access to free software.

### Breach/Cyber Security Incident Recovery

Unless explicitly stated in the Quote, the Services do not cover the remediation and recovery from a Security Incident. If you require such services, they will be provided separately on a time and materials basis. Please note that the time required to resolve a Security Incident and the recoverability of all impacted data cannot be guaranteed.

In this section, a Security Incident refers to any unauthorized or improper access to or use of the Environment, or any unauthorized or improper disclosure of Client's confidential information, which compromises the security or privacy of the information or applications in the Environment, or disrupts the normal functions of the Environment.

### Environmental Factors

We cannot guarantee that installed equipment will operate without errors or interruptions, or that video or audio equipment will capture events clearly in all environmental conditions, such as water, heat, cold, or varying lighting conditions. These factors may cause malfunctions in the equipment. This warranty does not apply unless explicitly stated in the Quote.

### Fair Usage Policy

Our Fair Usage Policy (FUP) applies to services that are described as "unlimited" or not expressly capped in terms of usage hours per month. If a service is designated as "unlimited," it means that you can use it without incurring additional time-based or usage-based costs, subject to the terms of the FUP. However, please note that unlimited services are provided only during normal business hours and are subject to the availability of our technicians.

To follow the FUP, we kindly request that you refrain from creating urgent support tickets for non-urgent or non-critical issues, requesting excessive support services that are inconsistent with normal usage patterns, and requesting support or services that may interfere with our ability to serve other customers effectively.

### Hosted Email

You are responsible for using the hosted email service provided to you ("Hosted Email") properly. The use of Hosted Email is subject to acceptable use policies ("AUPs"), and you must follow those AUPs. When using Hosted Email, you agree not to upload, post, transmit, or distribute any prohibited content, which includes content that is obscene, illegal, violates intellectual property or privacy rights, mischaracterizes you, interferes with services, or contains malicious code. Additionally, you must not use Hosted Email for sending unsolicited commercial electronic messages ("SPAM") in violation of any laws. 2Fifteen reserves the right to suspend your access to Hosted Email if it believes your account is being used improperly or illegally.

### Patch Management

2Fifteen will ensure that all managed hardware and software receive critical patches and updates in a timely manner. It's important to note that these patches, which are developed by third-party vendors, may occasionally cause instability or malfunctions in the environment or managed equipment/software, even when installed correctly. In such cases, 2Fifteen is not liable for any resulting downtime or losses. Additionally, if 2Fifteen is aware of technical issues caused by a specific patch or believes it may cause instability, they reserve the right to refrain from installing it.

### Backup, Disaster, and Recovery (BDR) Services

Please note that while using the internet, there is a risk of malware and computer contaminants that can include viruses, worms, and Trojan horses. Additionally, malicious actors may attempt unauthorized access or damage to client data. Neither 2Fifteen nor its designated affiliates will be held responsible for the outcome or consequences of such activities.

For the BDR (Backup and Disaster Recovery) services, it is important to have a reliable and always-connected internet solution. The speed and reliability of your internet connection can impact the time it takes for data backup and recovery. Outages in internet and telecommunications services can prevent BDR services from functioning properly. It is also important to note that computer hardware can fail due to equipment malfunctions or telecommunication issues, for which we cannot be held responsible. Despite efforts to minimize errors, computer hardware, including communication equipment, network servers, and related devices, may still have a certain rate of error transactions that cannot be completely eliminated. We cannot guarantee the prevention of data corruption or loss. The client agrees to hold 2Fifteen harmless in the event of such data corruption or loss.

⚠️ **Note** - To mitigate against the unintentional loss of data, we strongly advise the client to keep multiple backup copies of all important stored data.

### Procurement and Lifecycle Management

Equipment and software purchased by 2Fifteen on behalf of the Client ("Procured Equipment") may come with manufacturer warranties, which will be passed on to the Client as much as possible. However, 2Fifteen does not provide any warranties or guarantees regarding the quality, integrity, or usefulness of the Procured Equipment.

Please note that certain equipment or software may not be returnable or may be subject to third-party return policies and restocking fees. If the Client requests a return of the Procured Equipment, all associated fees will be the responsibility of the Client. It's important to understand that 2Fifteen is not a warranty service or repair center. While we can assist with facilitating the return or warranty repair of Procured Equipment, the return or warranty repair process is governed by the terms of the warranties (if any) provided by the manufacturer. Once the equipment has been handed over to the designated shipping or delivery courier, 2Fifteen will not be held responsible for the quantity, condition, or timely delivery of the Procured Equipment.

Apple Equipment: We are not an Apple reseller and therefore cannot directly purchase Apple equipment or devices for our clients. However, we recommend discussing any planned Apple device purchases with us to ensure compatibility with our services and monitoring capabilities.

Our lifecycle management services will look up hardware purchase dates and, where possible, warranty information. As part of our managed services we provide reporting on the age of your equipment, as well as recommendations on when older equipment should be replaced.

### Penetration Testing; Vulnerability Assessment

By agreeing to the penetration testing process, you understand that security measures, both physical and virtual, may be triggered. Although we strive to prevent such incidents, it is possible that security devices, alarms, or other measures may be activated during the testing. It is your responsibility to inform any monitoring company and law enforcement of the possibility of "false alarms" due to the testing. You must take necessary measures to ensure that false alarms are not treated as real threats.

Activation of certain alarms or advanced security measures may result in the temporary or complete shutdown of your system, leading to significant downtime or delays in your business operations. We are not liable for any claims, costs, fees, or expenses arising from: (i) the response of monitoring companies or law enforcement to the testing, or (ii) the system shutdown caused by alarms or security devices.

### No Third Party Scanning

Unauthorized testing activities, including any diagnostic or security tests of the implemented security system, protocols, processes, or solutions in the managed environment, are not allowed unless written authorization is provided. Any services needed to diagnose or resolve errors, issues, or problems resulting from unauthorized testing activities are not included in the Quote.

### Obsolescence

If any part of the managed environment becomes outdated, obsolete, reaches the end of its useful life, or is no longer supported by the manufacturer ("Obsolete Element"), we may consider it unsupported or non-standard. We may ask you to update the Obsolete Element within a reasonable timeframe. If you don't replace the Obsolete Element promptly, we have two options:

1. We can continue providing services to the Obsolete Element with our best efforts, but without any warranty or requirement for fixing issues related to its operability or functionality.  
     
2. We can exclude the Obsolete Element from the scope of our services by notifying you in writing (email is sufficient).

Please note that we don't provide any guarantees or warranties for any Obsolete Element or for any deployment, service level assurances, or remediation activities related to it.
